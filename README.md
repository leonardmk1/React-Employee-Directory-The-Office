# React Employee Directory

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. This assignment will required me to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events using The Office Employee Direcrtory.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Getting Started
- run the app using `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
- enjoy!
